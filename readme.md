To get the repository, `git clone https://github.com/aforren1/3dhand`

Create the environment with `conda env create -f env.yml`

Activate the environment with `activate 3dhand`

Install panda3d via `pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://archive.panda3d.org/ panda3d`
(haven't figured out how to feed that in via the yaml file)

Run the demo via `python main.py`
